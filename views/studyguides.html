				<ul>
					<li> "Everything about Theseus: Story of Theseus's full life. It is very thorough; it should get you about through Level 3 Finals. However, to make life easy for those of you who do not in any realm of potentiality wish to attain that level of knowledge yet, the most important names have been bolded. The three episodes left off were, if you feel really hardcore, Perigune, the Marathonian bull, and Hecale." -Anne Marie Creighton, Class of 2010</li>
